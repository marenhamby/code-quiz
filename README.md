# code-quiz


## Description
    
    This activity was my first attempt at using local storage and dynamically changing page content. This should generate a quiz which moves from question to question when an answer is clicked on. It also tracks if the answer given is correct or not and incorrect answers lose an additional 10 seconds from the constantly decrementing quiz timer. At the end of the quiz the user enters their initials which are saved locally along with the amount of time the user has left, which is the final score. The locally stored items are rendered on the high score page and can be cleared with the button on screen.
